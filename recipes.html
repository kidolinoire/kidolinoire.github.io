        <ul>
          <li>4 medium potatoes</li>
          <li>1/3 C sour cream </li>
          <li>1/2 C shredded chedder cheese</li>
          <li>3 T green onion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Wash potatoes thoroughly with a stiff brush and cold running water. Dry, then using a standard fork poke 8 to 12 deep holes all over the spud so that moisture can escape during cooking. Place in a bowl and coat lightly with oil. Sprinkle with kosher salt and place potato directly on rack in middle of oven. Place a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any drippings.</p>
        <p>Bake 1 hour or until skin feels crisp but flesh beneath feels soft. Serve by creating a dotted line from end to end with your fork, then crack the spud open by squeezing the ends towards one another. It will pop right open. But watch out, there will be some steam.</p>
        <p>Top with sour cream, cheese, onion, or other toppings of choice.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1 clove garlic, smashed</li>
          <li>2 T unsalted butter</li>
          <li>1 pounds potatoes</li>
          <li>2 C half & half</li>
          <li>1 T salt</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Rub the garlic around the inside of an 8 by 8 by 2-inch casserole dish and let it dry. Reserve the remaining garlic. Rub the butter around the inside of the dish. Reserve the remaining butter.</p>
        <p>Peel and thinly slice the potatoes on a mandoline or vegetable slicer (about 1/8-inch-thick slices).</p>
        <p>In a medium saucepan, combine the garlic, butter, potatoes, half-and-half, salt, pepper to taste, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring, until the mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish. Shake the pan so the potatoes are distributed evenly.</p>
        <p>Bake the potatoes, basting occasionally, until lightly browned and bubbly, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>4 pounds potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters</li>
          <li>1 bay leaf</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper</li>
          <li>2 C heavy cream</li>
          <li>3 T unsalted butter</li>
          <li>2 T chopped chives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Put the potatoes into a large pot, add the bay leaf, 2 tablespoons salt, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain them well and remove the bay leaf. Meanwhile, heat the cream and butter in a small saucepan. Put the potatoes through a ricer or food mill into a bowl. Add the hot cream and season with salt and pepper. Mix together with a spoon and add the chives.</p>
